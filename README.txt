# Velux Homey App

This Homey app adds support for Velux devices using io-homecontrol and the KLF-200 gateway. It allows you to control and automate your Velux windows, blinds, and other compatible devices directly from your Homey smart home hub.

## Features
- Discover and pair Velux devices via the KLF-200 gateway
- Control window openers only for now
- Automate Velux devices with Homey Flows
- Uses a robust keep-alive connection to the gateway for reliability

## How it Works
This app communicates with your KLF-200 gateway using the excellent [klf-200-api](https://github.com/MiSchroe/klf-200-api) library. The app manages the connection, device discovery, and exposes Velux devices to Homey for automation and control.

## Credits
**Huge thanks to [MiSchroe/klf-200-api](https://github.com/MiSchroe/klf-200-api) for creating and maintaining the KLF-200 API library!**

This app would not be possible without their work reverse-engineering and documenting the KLF-200 protocol, and providing a high-quality Node.js library for integration.

## Requirements
- Homey Pro
- Velux KLF-200 gateway
- Velux io-homecontrol devices

## Setup
1. Install the app on your Homey for now using the homey cli
2. Enter your KLF-200 gateway IP address and password in the app settings
3. Pair your Velux devices via the Homey app
4. Start automating!
